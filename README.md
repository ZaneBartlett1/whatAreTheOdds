# What is it

The apps aims to give a rough estimate of the amount of people would be in a given city from selected attributes

# Why

- The data is often freely available
- Attention grabbing
- Can be as hard or as easy as I wanted to make it, granted it does lose accuracy with every simplification

# Stack

This is a purely front end project. It utilizes the Svelte framework with Vite as the build tool. At the time of writing it's not hosted, but will likely be hosted on CloudFlare

# In the future

I would like to get the data more and more granular. The biggest issue right now is adding education and income. Education is broken into brackets that don't follow the same structure as what I use for age and income data that I could find could brake it down by ethnicity, but not by gender within ethnicity. Other issues with income include it not being broken down by geography, which is a big factor due to cost of living often affecting wages in the area.
