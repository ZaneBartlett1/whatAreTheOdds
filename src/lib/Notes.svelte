    <h2>Things I felt where worth noting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All of this data come from averages from different studies, not raw
            data. This means in some cases I'm able to break the data down by
            state, ethnicity, sex, etc, but usually I can only do some of those
            given the datasets
        </li>
        <li>
            Sex ratios are derived from the United States ratio of male and
            female by age, and assumed to be consistent throughout each state.
            As in, the age bracket 20-24 there are "M": 11384263, "F": 10964564,
            and it's assumed that ratio within that age bracket between male and
            female is the same in every state
        </li>
        <li>
            I sourced cities with the highest population, but did no research or
            try to account for how large cities and metros affect the attributes
            we're looking at. While I didn't include a political leaning as an
            attribute, that is an obvious one that is usually heavily affected
            by being in a large city, for example
        </li>
        <li>
            The percentage derived between ages are assumed to be consistent
            throughout states as well
        </li>
        <li>
            Height was calculated by taking the average height for males and
            females and calculating other height bins with the SD and assumption
            that there's a normal distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
            Income isn't broken into state, ethnicity, or sex, and is a
            household income. It's a general average, I do plan/hope to address
            this in the future
        </li>
        <li>Penis length is an average</li>
        <li>Religion is based on national averages</li>
        <li>
